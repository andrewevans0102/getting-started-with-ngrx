# getting-started-with-ngrx

This repo is made for a list of resources for getting started with [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/).

## Getting Started

Before starting with NgRx, it really helps to have a foundation in RxJS. Many of the features of NgRx rely on an understanding of Observables and more generally streams. This can be hard for some folks just starting out as it is a very different way of thinking. I highly recommend checking out my post [Getting Started with RxJS](https://rhythmandbinary.com/post/Getting_Started_with_RxJS).

It also helps to have a more general understanding of Functional Programming. There are several great videos and a quick YouTube search should get you started.

I also highly recommend using the [Chrome Redux DevTools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) with this application locally.

To get started I recommend reading my post [How to Start Flying with Angular and NgRx](https://indepth.dev/how-to-start-flying-with-angular-and-ngrx/). This post has an introduction to using NgRx with my project [Goose Weather](https://github.com/andrewevans0102/goose-weather).

I also recommend reading [Adding NgRx to Your Existing Applications](https://indepth.dev/adding-ngrx-to-your-existing-applications/). This post shows hows to add NgRx while also using the new "create" functions with my GitHub project [here](https://github.com/andrewevans0102/to-do-with-ngrx).

## Feature State vs Root State

When building a complex application, you may consider defining your state by feature. I found Wes Grimes article [NgRx — Best Practices for Enterprise Angular Applications](https://wesleygrimes.com/angular/2018/05/30/ngrx-best-practices-for-enterprise-angular-applications) really helpful with this approach.

I recommend reading my post [NgRx Feature State vs. Root State](https://rhythmandbinary.com/post/2020-06-22-ngrx-feature-state-vs-root-state). In this post I show how to setup an application with "feature" state with my project [Reyrey's Orders](https://www.github.com/andrewevans0102/reyreys-orders).

## More Resources

There are a lot of great resources available. I recommend checking out the NgRx resource page [here](https://ngrx.io/resources). I also recommend the article on best practices [here](https://wesleygrimes.com/angular/2018/05/30/ngrx-best-practices-for-enterprise-angular-applications).
